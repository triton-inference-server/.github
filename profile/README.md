# NVIDIA Triton Inference Server Organization
[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server)
provides a cloud and edge inferencing solution optimized for both CPUs and GPUs.

This top level GitHub organization host repositories for officially supported 
backends, including [TensorRT](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrt_backend), [TensorFlow](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorflow_backend), 
[PyTorch](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/pytorch_backend), 
[Python](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend), 
[ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/onnxruntime_backend), 
and [OpenVino](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/openvino_backend). The
organization also hosts several popular Triton tools, including:

* [Model Analyzer](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_analyzer):
A tool to analyze the runtime performance of a model and provide an optimized 
model configuration for Triton Inference Server.

* [Model Navigator](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_navigator):
a tool that provides the ability to automate the process of moving a model from source to optimal format and configuration for deployment on Triton Inference Server.

## Getting Started
